  <title>FlyBase Chado DB r4.1.1</title>
  <about>
   Configurations to extract feature and sequence data for
   bulk files from FlyBase chado databases, including various
   release information.
  </about>

  <notes id="r411">
   Update r4.1.1 notes:  this release contains
    1) Changes to gene models due to problems found in the GB-submission process
    2) Fixes and additions of non-gm / non-gb-submitted data (eg, evidence, 
insertions, and I believe loads of ARGS data).

2. migrated missed BACs on arms 3L and part of X
3. updated 26 accession.version dbxrefs associated with proteins
4. fix evidence for all sim4 and blast*, which have incorrect alignment string
5. re-load missed sim4tandem evidence for arm 4 and 2L
6. updates for insertions
