SYNOPSIS
      GMODTools is a collection of perl scripts for use
      with GMOD Chado databases, primarily at this point
      for loading and extracting miscellaneous sequences.
  
      Many of the sequence functions are in library module
        GMOD::Chado::SeqUtils -- common methods for these chado seq scripts
      with main programs in bin/ folder as summarized below.
  
      It is based on GMOD release 0.001 (January 2004) and can
      be expected to change or go obsolete.  Besides contents of
      this package, requirements to run include the perl modules
      installed with GMOD release, esp. Chado::LoadDBI/AutoDBI and
      its ancestor classes from CPAN - Class::DBI, Ima::DBI, etc.
  
      This was written for use with the nascent Daphnia genome database,
      wFleaBase, at http://eugenes.org/daphnia/ See also further information
      at http://eugenes.org/daphnia/database

NAME
    gmod_init_db.pl

SYNOPSIS
      A simple script to create the Chado database and tables
      based on test_load.pl.   d.gilbert added:
        parts to load in initialize.sql, 
        add new organisms, 
        add user choice of ontologies, which must exist in GMOD_ROOT/data/ontologies/

      Assumes that Chado::LoadDBI is available for ontologies

NAME
    gmod_load_newseq.pl

SYNOPSIS
    Load a file of miscellany sequences into chado db, generating public
    IDs. Sequences are assumed to be non-genomic, not located.

NOTES
    Good for small seqs: cDNA, EST, microsats, ; left out genome-sized
    methods. Need for nascent daphnia wFleaBase to get sequence public IDs
    Cut from gmod_load_gff3.pl

NAME
    gmod_dump_seq.pl - Print sequences from ChadoDB

SYNOPSIS
    Dump sequence file of Chado features, with feature props, synonyms,
    dbxrefs xSelect by organism, by 'pub' = input file, seq type, feat props
    Need for nascent daphnia wFleaBase to use sequence public IDs

    Good for small seqs: cDNA, EST, microsats. Left out genome-sized
    methods. Only does fasta format now

NAME
      gmod_list_db.pl

SYNOPSIS
    Summarize feature entries in a Chado database, by publication (input
    file), by Seq. Ontology type (cDNA, EST, etc.), by organism. Add other
    categories as needed.

SEE ALSO
      gmod_init_db.pl -- initialize a new database, adding organisms, intialize.sql,
         ontology data sets.
     
      gmod_dump_seq.pl -- output sequences selected by organism, publication (input file),
         seq type.
     
      gmod_list_db.pl  -- show feature statistics for chado db: # per organism, per seq type,
        per publication/infile, and checksum test for sequence duplications.

      GMOD::Chado::SeqUtils -- common methods for these chado seq scripts
