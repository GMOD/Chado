all modules
	ditched timeentered and timelastmod columns in every table
		We've decided that auditing is implementation specific.
		We're presently working on the FB implementation, and
		  will make that available soon
	changed all dbxrefstr foreign keys to dbxref_id
	added indexes for every foreign key column in every table

general module:

	dbxref
		removed dbxref.dbxrefstr
		removed unique key (dbxrefstr)

cv module:

	New table:
		added table cv to hold cv names
	cvterm
		changed accordingly
	cvpath
		changed accordingly	


organism module:

	organism_dbxref
		added unique key (organism_id,dbxref_id)

pub module

	pub
		added miniref
		added unique key (miniref)
	pub_author
		added unique key (author_id,pub_id)
	author
		added unique key (surname,givenname,suffix)

	
sequence module

	Deleted table
		feature_organism
	feature
		added foreign key organism_id (not null)
		added uniquename column (not null)
		added unique key (organism_id,uniquename)
		made type_id not null
	featureloc
		added unique key (feature_id,locgroup,rank)
	feature_dbxref
		changed unique key to (feature_id,dbxref_id)
			- was (feature_dbxref_id, dbxref_id)  OK???
	feature_relationship
		changed type_id int attribute to not null


genetic module

NOTE:  We don't have unique keys on genotype, phenotype, and interaction.
       Since we're going to be having a schema review on this module soon,
       I decided not to worry about these for the time being.

	feature_genotype
		added unique key (feature_id,genotype_id)
	feature_phenotype
		added unique key (feature_id,phenotype_id)
	phenotype_cvterm
		added unique key (phenotype_id,cvterm_id,prank)
	interaction_subj
		added unique key (feature_id,interaction_id)
	interaction_obj
		added unique key (feature_id,interaction_id)

companalysis module

	analysis
		added unique key (program,programversion)
	analysisfeature
		changed unique key to (feature_id,analysis_id)
			was (feature_id)	

expression module

	expression
		doesn't have a unique key!  But what would it be?
	feature_expression
		added unique key (expression_id,feature_id)
	expression_cvterm
		added unique key (expression_id,cvterm_id)
	expression_pub
		added unique key (expression_id,pub_id)
	eimage
		doesn't have a unique key! What would it be?
	expression_image
		added unique key (expression_id,eimage_id)

map module

	I've skipped this one except for ditching the auditing attributes
	and dbxrefstr stuff... still needs lots of work!   Maybe we could
	do a mini-review on this module sometime soon?  I've got some
	examples of how I use a rejigged featurepos table to manage the
	fragmented a.gambiae genome, but I'd bet what I did can be 
	improved upon.
