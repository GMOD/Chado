                            CHADO INSTALLATION

$Id: INSTALL,v 1.2 2003-12-03 23:26:12 kycl4rk Exp $

This document describes how to install the Chado schema:

1.  First, you must set the following variables in your environment:

*   GMOD_ROOT: The location of your GMOD installation (e.g., "/usr/local/gmod")

*   CHADO_DB_NAME: The name of your Chado database

*   CHADO_DB_USERNAME: The username to connect to Chado

*   CHADO_DB_PASSWORD: The password for the database user

*   CHADO_DB_HOST: The host on which the database runs (e.g. "localhost") [opt]

*   CHADO_DB_PORT: The port on which the database is listening [opt]

As indicated, the host and port are optional.

2.  Next, run the following commands:

*   perl Makefile.PL   
    Creates AutoDBI.pm.

*   make test_load
    Creates database, installs schema.  Note: this is a destructive load
    as it will first drop the Chado database.

*   perl load/Build.PL load_conf=load/etc/load.conf
    Creates Build (part of Module::Build).

*   ./Build
    To move the just created LoadDBI.pm to blib
    Edit "load/etc/load.conf" (not necessary now, right?)
    and "load/etc/initialize.sql" (really?)

*   ./Build prepdb
    Inserts a few useful items into fundamental Chado tables.

*   rm -rf /tmp/chado_load/*
    Only necessary if rebuilding -- shouldn't the code do this automatically?

*   ./Build ontologies
    Gets and installs various ontologies
    Edit "lib/Chado/LoadDBI.pm" to remove Autocommit (really?)

*   load/bin/load_gff3.pl --organism Ecoli --srcdb DB:genbank \
    --gfffile dat/NC_000913.gff
    Loads GFF file
