    <h1>Perl Tools for Chado</h1>

    <h3>Note</h3>

     These tools are <b>unsupported</b> - I really just wrote them for
     my own use, feel free to download and play with them, just don't
     base any critical code on them, because they are liable to change
     at any time.

    <h2>Modules Required</h2>

    In addition to some standard CPAN modules, you will need the
    following:

    <h3>XML::NestArray</h3>

    This is a module I wrote for dealing with nested array / tree
    datastructures that uses XML. It also has a native indented text
    format, that I find preferable for viewing/editing in emacs.

    <p>

      This will eventually be uploaded to CPAN, but for now you can
      get it from the <a
			 href="http://www.fruitfly.org/developers">BDGP CVS Repository</a>, check out the project scratch/xml-nestarray.

    <h3>Bio::XML</h3>

    This is a module for dealing with biological data (such as
    features) as nested arrays/xml. This may eventually go into
    bioperl, but it is different from the bioperl approach, as it is
    emphatically <b>not</b> object oriented. The core of the code is
    just a series of transforms in Bio::XML::Sequence::Transform; for
    instance, inferring UTR from exons; inferring splice sites;
    inferring coordinates of composite features (eg transcripts) from
    the coordinates of leaf features (eg exons); coordinate
    transformations

    <p>
      
      In addition to being a relational database, Chado will also need
      a <b>Domain Logic Layer</b>. This is one example of how that
      layer may look. Other alternatives include SQL (views and
      procedures), XSLT and an Object Oriented layer. My personal
      views are fairly anti-OO these days, but that's just me.

    <p>

      Bio::XML is checked into the chado repository, right here, see
      <a href=".">This directory</a> (Click on "Bio").

    <h2>Tools</h2>

    After all that, there's really just one tool so far

    <h3>fgraph</h3>

    This draws a network graph diagram showing Chado data. Right now
    it works if you feed it XML::NestArray style indented text or
    XML. The XML it expects will probably differ from official Chado
    XML, it uses a schema transformation I find useful. Eventually it
    should all be in sync.

    <p>
      
      For an example of the graph images produced, see

      <a href="../../../modules/sequence/examples/gene_split">Sequence
	Module examples</a>
      <br>
      or
      <br>
      <a href="../../../modules/companalysis/examples/basic">Comp Analysis
	Module examples</a>

    <p>
      This tool requires GraphViz from CPAN.
