Chado-XML
=========

Chado-XML is a direct mapping of the Chado relational schema into
XML. Currently the only tool for performing this mapping is XML::XORT,
which can dump or save Chado-XML to and from a chado db.

Macros
------

The basic chado-xml expansion can be extremely verbose - this is
because chado-xml uses the unique keys from the chado db, yet it does
not database internal foreign keys.

Macros can be used to capture repeated nodes in the xml and give them
XML IDs that are valid within a particular document.
