The chado expression module is currently in a state of transition from
a first-pass skeleton module to a module that fully models MAGE-OM.

There are several files in this directory because of this, described below:

file				              purpose
-------------------------------------------------------------------
expression.sql   This is the skeleton module from early schema
					           versions.  it is not MAGE-OM compliant, and
					           is not recommended to be used by new chado
					           users.  This file will soon be overwritten
					           by rad.sql.
rad.sql				     This is a port of rad.oracle from the GUS
                          schema to postgres SQL. There were many
								  table and field name changes
					           to conform to the naming conventions of chado,
					           and the foreign key relationships of some of
					           the tables had to be redirected to point to the
					           chado equivalent of the GUS tables.  This file
					           will soon be renamed to expression.sql.
rad.views			  This file is a partial port of the views that
					           come with RAD.  RAD is capable of handling
					           single and multichannel microarrays, SAGE,
					           Northern, and perhaps other types of expression
					           data.  This is accomplished using views on
					           some of the tables in rad.sql.  The porter of
					           the RAD views only intends to store single
					           channel arrays in chado, so only took the
					           trouble to port the single channel views.
					           other views are available in this file, but
					           are unported and commented.
