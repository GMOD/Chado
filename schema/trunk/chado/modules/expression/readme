chado expression module is currently in a state of transition from
a first-pass skeleton module to a module that fully models MAGE-OM.

there are several files in this directory because of this.  each is
described below:

file				purpose
-------------------------------------------------------------------
expression.sql      this is the skeleton module from early schema
					versions.  it is not MAGE-OM compliant, and
					is not recommended to be used by new chado
					users.  This file will soon be overwritten
					by rad.sql.
rad.oracle			this is the original schema of the
					RNA Abundance Database (RAD), a module of
					GUS (Genomics Unified Schema).  It is purported
					to be MAGE-OM compliant.  This file contains
					Oracle-specific SQL, and is incompatible with
					chado.  It is here for reference only, and will
					be removed from the distribution in the near
					future.
rad.sql				This is a port of rad.oracle to postgres sql.
					There were many table and field namechanges
					to conform to the naming conventions of chado,
					and the foreign key relationships of some of
					the tables had to be redirected to point to the
					chado equivalent of the GUS tables.  This file
					will soon be renamed to expression.sql.
rad.views			This file is a partial port of the views that
					come with RAD.  RAD is capable of handling
					single and multichannel microarrays, SAGE,
					Northern, and perhaps other types of expression
					data.  This is accomplished using views on
					some of the tables in rad.sql.  The porter of
					the RAD views only intends to store single
					channel arrays in chado, so only took the
					trouble to port the single channel views.
					other views are available in this file, but
					are unported and commented.
