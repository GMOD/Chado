<bridge_layer schema="godb">
  <notes>
    Bridge layer for GO Database schema - allows chado to "masquerade"
    as a GO-DB Schema, which means we can use go-db software; eg
    AmiGO. Currently read-only

    Activate this to make this bridge take precedence
    SET SEARCH_PATH TO godb,public;
    (note that placing godb first in the search path means
    that godb.dbxref takes precedence over public.dbxref)
