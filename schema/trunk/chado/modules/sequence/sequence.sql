-- TABLE: featureloc
-- ================================================

-- each feature can have 0 or more locations.
-- multiple locations do NOT indicate non-contiguous locations.
-- instead they designate alternate locations or grouped locations;
-- for instance, a feature designating a blast hit or hsp will have two
-- locations, one on the query feature, one on the subject feature.
-- features representing sequence variation could have alternate locations
-- instantiated on a feature on the mutant strain.
-- the field "rank" is used to differentiate these different locations.
-- the default rank '0' is used for the main/primary location (eg in
-- similarity features, 0 is query, 1 is subject), although sometimes
-- this will be symmeytical and there is no primary location.
--
-- redundant locations can also be stored - for instance, the position
-- of an exon on a BAC and in global coordinates. the field "locgroup"
-- is used to differentiate these groupings of locations. the default
-- locgroup '0' is used for the main/primary location, from which the
-- others can be derived via coordinate transformations. another
-- example of redundant locations is storing ORF coordinates relative
-- to both transcript and genome. redundant locations open the possibility
-- of the database getting into inconsistent states; this schema gives
-- us the flexibility of both 'warehouse' instantiations with redundant
-- locations (easier for querying) and 'management' instantiations with
-- no redundant locations.

-- most features (exons, transcripts, etc) will have 1 location, with
-- locgroup and rank equal to 0
--
-- an example of using both locgroup and rank:
-- imagine a feature indicating a conserved region between the chromosomes
-- of two different species. we may want to keep redundant locations on
-- both contigs and chromosomes. we would thus have 4 locations for the
-- single conserved region feature - two distinct locgroups (contig level
-- and chromosome level) and two distinct ranks (for the two species).

-- altresidues is used to store alternate residues of a feature, when these
-- differ from feature.residues. for instance, a SNP feature located on
-- a wild and mutant protein would have different alresidues.
-- for alignment/similarity features, the altresidues is used to represent
-- the alignment string.

-- note on variation features; even if we don't want to instantiate a mutant
-- chromosome/contig feature, we can still represent a SNP etc with 2 locations,
-- one (rank 0) on the genome, the other (rank 1) would have most fields null,
-- except for altresidues

-- IMPORTANT: fnbeg and fnend are space-based (INTERBASE) coordinates
-- this is vital as it allows us to represent zero-length
-- features eg splice sites, insertion points without
-- an awkward fuzzy system

-- Note that nbeg and nend have been replaced with fmin and fmax,
-- which are the minimum and maximum coordinates of the feature
-- relative to the parent feature.  By contrast,
-- nbeg, nend are for feature natural begin/end
-- by natural begin, end we mean these are the actual
-- beginning (5' position) and actual end (3' position)
-- rather than the low position and high position, as
-- these terms are sometimes erroneously used.  To compensate
-- for the removal of nbeg and nend from featureloc, a view
-- based on featureloc, dfeatureloc, is provided in sequence_views.sql.
