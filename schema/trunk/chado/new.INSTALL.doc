This is the first pass at the new install doc and at the moment is
merely a collection of my notes and thoughts on the installation
procedure.

SIMPLE INSTALL

Use Fedora Core 2, yum and biopackages.net

LESS SIMPLE INSTALL

Use the default schema and build from source

HARD INSTALL

Interactively build schema using chado-build-schema.pl and
then install from source.  To do this, Makefile.PL will change and
no longer ask 'do you want to use the default schema', instead, it 
will assume that whatever schema is currently in the modules 
directory is the one that will be used.  (It should no doubt
issue a warning indicating that is what it is doing.)  In this 
scenerio, the schema building step takes place before `perl Makefile.PL`
though we will probably want a command line flag to let Makefile.PL
know that the default schema is not being used so that the Class::DBI 
objects get rebuilt.

The source installs will still then follow the same sort of outline:

  make
  make install
  make load_schema
  make prepdb
  make ontologies (using go-perl DBIx::DBStag)


Other notes:

Needed for 'make ontologies' is go-perl; it can be obtained from
http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/ and downloading any of the
monthly, weekly, or daily version of go_*-utilities.tar.gz and then 
setting the GO_ROOT environment variable to the path to the directory that
contains the go-perl directory.
