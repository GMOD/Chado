This package contains utility files for the community annotation system.
Currently, this consists of CGI files for making GAME or Chado XML files
for use by a WebStart Apollo application and a CGI for users to upload
their saved GAME or Chado XML files.

In order to work properly, this set of tools requires that several things
be installed already:

  A Chado database populated with data
  GBrowse (preferable 1.69 or better)
  Apollo (both a compiled and signed webstart as well as the compiled
     application on the server)


To install, run

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  sudo ./Build install

Future additions to this package include tools to fascilitate the 
Chado/MediaWiki roundtrip.
