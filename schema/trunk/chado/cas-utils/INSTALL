Run perl Build.PL and it will ask you several questions, or check 
perl Build.PL -h for commandline configuration options.  After getting the
configuration the way you like it, run ./Build and sudo ./Build install
to put the Util module and cgi files in the appropriate place.

I fully expect that there will be things I didn't consider in making this
first release of this package, even though I tried.  Please let me 
know what issues you run into using this package.
