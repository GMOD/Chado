INTRODUCTION
------------

Chado is a modular schema for handling all kinds of biological
data.  It is intended to be used as both a primary datastore schema as
well as a warehouse style schema.

Chado was originally conceived as the next generation flybase
database, combining the sequence annotation database gadfly with the
Harvard and Cambridge databases.  We have endeavoured to avoid organism
or project specificity in the schema, and we hope it will be of use to
other projects.

The modules currently in chado are:

general
cv           - controlled vocabularies and ontologies
sequence     - dna, rna and protein features
companalysis - computational analyses
genetic      - genetic and phenotypic data
expression   - rna or protein expression data
organism     - 
pub          - publication and references

Other modules are possible; the existing modules cover a very large
variety of use cases, documented elsewhere (?).

Chado has a fairly abstract schema, ontologies and controlled
vocabularies (CVs) are utilised where their use is favourable to
relational modeling.  In particular, the sequence ontology is vital to
the sequence module.

Some (but not all) of the use cases we have discussed are:

* Central dogma genome annotations

* Genes that break the central dogma (of which there are many
  Annotated in fly, including polycistronic transcripts, transplicing,
  selenocysteine readthroughs, rna editing, ....)

* Sequence variation data, including SNPs, transposable element
  insertions, indels, ... how this relates to phenotypes, how these
  effect the central dogma....

* Non-wildtype data, including representing a wildtype transcriptome
  and proteome on a non wildtype genome; implicit and explicit central
  dogma examples for mutant strains

* Complex phenotypic data

* Ontologies structured as graphs; querying over graph ontologies
  non-recursively by precimputing the closure

* Sequence ontology

* Comparative data

* Genetic interactions

* Transgene constructs, complex genetic experiments and their results

The core schema is DBMS independent.  The SQL table create files can
be found in the chado/modules directory.  The main Chado developers
are currently using PostgreSQL.

INSTALLATION
------------

Please read the included INSTALL document for instructions on how to
install the Chado schema.

You might also want to have a look at the README.* files in this directory
for instructions on how to deal with specific types of data.

AUTOGENERATION OF SCHEMA FILES, CODE, ETC
-----------------------------------------

The Chado Makefile currently supports:

Target			Purpose
--------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
all			makes cdbi, see below
cdbi			make Class::DBI interface classes (Chado::*) from sql source
diagram			make ER diagrams, one per module
graphviz		make graphviz diagrams, one per module

These transforms depend on the Perl scripts in "chado/bin" and the
SQL::Translator module (with all of its dependencies), which is
available on CPAN.
