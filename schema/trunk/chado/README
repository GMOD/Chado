INTRO
=====

chado is a modular schema for handling all kinds of biological
data. it is intended to be used as both a primary datastore schema as
well as a warehouse style schema.

chado was originally conceived as the next generation flybase
database, combining the sequence annotation database gadfly with the
harvard and cambridge databases. we have endeavoured to avoid organism
or project specificity in the schema, and we hope it will be of use to
other projects.

the modules currently in chado are:

general
cv           - controlled vocabularies and ontologies
sequence     - dna, rna and protein features
companalysis - computational analyses
genetic      - genetic and phenotypic data
expression   - rna or protein expression data
organism     - 
pub          - publication and references

other modules are possible; the existing modules cover a very large
variety of use cases, documented elsewhere (?).

chado has a fairly abstract schema, ontologies and CVs are utilised
where their use is favourable to relational modeling. in particular,
the sequence ontology is vital to the sequence module.

some (but not all) of the use cases we have discussed are:

* central dogma genome annotations

* genes that break the central dogma (of which there are many
* annotated in fly, including polycistronic transcripts, transplicing,
* selenocysteine readthroughs, rna editing, ....)

* sequence variation data, including snps, transposable element
* insertions, indels, ... how this relates to phenotypes, how these
* effect the central dogma....

* non-wildtype data, including representing a wildtype transcriptome
* and proteome on a non wildtype genome; implicit and explicit central
* dogma examples for mutant strains

* complex phenotypic data

* ontologies structured as graphs; querying over graph ontologies
* non-recursively by precimputing the closure

* sequence ontology

* comparative data

* genetic interactions

* transgene constructs, complex genetic experiments and their results

The core schema is DBMS independent. The main chado developers are
currently using postgresql. There may be additional optional layers
that use views, triggers, procedures, constraints etc which may be
postgresql specific.

The SQL table create files can be found in the chado/modules directory.  
While these files are for creating a PostgreSQL database, there is also a
Makefile in chado.  Running 'make all' will autogenerate MySQL
counterparts to these files.  Note that the transform depends on a Perl
script, and Ken Clark's SQL::Translator module, available on CPAN.
