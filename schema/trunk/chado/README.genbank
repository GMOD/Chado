LOADING GENBANK RECORDS INTO CHADO

1. Download the Genbank genome record of interest.

2. Execute

   load/bin/genbank2gff3.pl <filename>

   This will convert the Genbank file to GFF version 3.  It may give several
   warnings about unrecognized feature types.  If the feature types are 
   not part of SOFA, you will have to hand edit the resulting GFF file
   to change the feature type.  Any skipped features will be printed at
   the end.  If you want those to be part of the GFF file, you will have
   to add those manually as well, fixing any non-SOFA feature types.

3. Add an entry for you organism in the chado organism table.  See

   load/bin/load_gff3.pl -h

   for details.

4. Execute

   load/bin/load_gff3.pl --organism  <your org> \
                         --srcdb DB:genbank  \
                         --gfffile <your gfffile>

   which will load your data to chado.  Note that if there are non-SOFA
   feature types remaining in the GFF file the load will fail when they
   are encountered.  If that happens, edit the file to fix the incorrect
   term and load again.  Only the previously unloaded data will load 
   (ie, you won't have duplicate rows [I think]).
