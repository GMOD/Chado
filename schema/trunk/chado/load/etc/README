Ontologies of feature properties to use for chado. The point of these
controlled vocabularies is to try to capture the terms you would
typically find as tags in a GFF file or GenBank entry. As such these
are not as coherent or uniform as the known OBO ontologies.

These may move to the SO CVS repository:

feature_property.obo
genbank_feature_property.obo
