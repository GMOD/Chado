=head1 NAME

gmod_sort_gff3.pl - Sorts a GFF3 file to put lines with Parent tags after their parent.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  % gmod_sort_gff3.pl --infile <gff file name> 

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

  --infile		Name of the input gff3 file (required)
  --outfile		Name of the output gff3 file
                           (default: sorted.gff)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a very simple (and only lightly tested) script for sorting
gff3 files so that all lines that have Parent tags come after the
line that contains the parent ID tag.  Files thusly sorted are
required for the GMOD chado bulk loader, L<gmod_bulk_load_gff3.pl>.
