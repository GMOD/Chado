Add documentation to README and/or INSTALL regarding Postgres VACUUM and ANALYZE
functions.  We might want to give users an example of how to set up a cron job
to do this nightly.  I had a 3 order of magnitude speed increase today from a 
10 second ANALYZE command.

We might also want to build an analyze() method into the loaders, or possibly
the middleware layer itself.  This will dramatically speed up large loads, but
requires changing the cache/flush strategy to the more complex
begin-transaction/cache/flush/end-transaction/analyze strategy.
