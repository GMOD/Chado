Add documentation to README and/or INSTALL regarding Postgres VACUUM and ANALYZE
functions.  We might want to give users an example of how to set up a cron job
to do this nightly.  I had a 3 order of magnitude speed increase today from a 
10 second ANALYZE command.  See 

   http://www.varlena.com/varlena/GeneralBits/Tidbits/perf.html

which has useful information for tuning postgresql.conf as well as a suggestion
for setting up the auto vacuum daemon.

We might also want to build an analyze() method into the loaders, or possibly
the middleware layer itself.  This will dramatically speed up large loads, but
requires changing the cache/flush strategy to the more complex
begin-transaction/cache/flush/end-transaction/analyze strategy.

where to start?

For the next release:
- integrate Apollo
- integrate a web front end (probably turnkey)
- provide a custom tag processing module for load_gff3.pl
- create a method for updating ontologies
- Makefile.PL should also track optional modules included and allow
  skipping the prompting for them
- create a method for populating cvtermpath (make_cvtermpath.pl is a starting
point).

For following releases:
- incorporate Pub*
- write a bulk load utility that will quickly load GFF3 data to chado
- write a utility that will delete data from the database with a GFF
file as a template
