How to use XORT and related API
1. add the env variable CodeBase to  where you gunzip the package to env, i.e in my case, all the code in dir /users/zhou/work/API, so I will add the following line to .cshrc file:
setenv CodeBase /users/zhou/work/API


2. create the ddl.properties file by running CodeBase/XORT/bin/ddl_properties_creator.pl, it will create the ddl.properties in CodeBase/XORT/Config
   before go further step, view CodeBase.XORT/Config/ddl.properties to see whether it make sense, if not, normally means that your ddl file DOES NOT have same format as samle ddl:CodeBase/XORT/Config/idb-full.ddl
   for all view/function, you need to MAKE one create TABLE statement for each view/function in another file(refer to CodeBase/XORT/Config/function_view.sql & function_view.ddl), this will be argument -v to ddl_properties_creator.pl


3. create database properties for each database you intend to use, and put those file in CodeBase/XORT/Config, name format: databasename.properties, i.e, for chado_gadfly5, the file name will be CodeBase/XORT/Config/chado_gadfly5.properties

4. log into the target database and execute CodeBase/XORT/Config/function_view.sql to synchronize the database
   here will create the necessary view, also because the current dump from Berkeley didn't have featureloc.min and featureloc.max, so need o add those two cols, if in the future you get the dump which already implement those change, then you can comment those sql statement which modify featureloc table. Refering CodeBase/XORT/Config/function_view.sql and function_view.ddl for how convert function and view into ddl format.

5. run CodeBase/XORT/bin/dump.pl  loader.pl validator.pl with -h for how to use it. 

6. CodeBase/XORT/Config/dumpspec_gene.xml for sample dumpspec file, and dump output from this dumpspec(dump_gene_local_id.xml)

7. If you try to use 'local_id' mechanism to represent an object, the dumper will use this format to represent it: 'table_name'.'_'.'primary_key', it will garantee the uniqueness. However, it is not necessary at all to use this format for loader, as long as its uniqueness, loader can handle it.
