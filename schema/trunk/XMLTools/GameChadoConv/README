This directory contains the makefile, which produces two
java .class files in the 'classes' subdirectory.  These
files are GTC.class, for Game To Chado conversion, and
CTG.class for Chado To Game conversion.

For both programs, the first input is the name of the file
to be read, and the second input is the name of the file
to be written.

GTC recognizes '-' parameters.
'-a' means convert 'all', both features and
	computational analyses. This is the default.
'-c' convert computational analyses, but not gene
	features
'-g' convert gene features, but ignore computational
	analyses
'-t' transactional - only convert those genes which
	are mentioned in a 'changed_gene' element

For all parameters except '-t', non annotation sequences
are converted.

CTG recognizes the '-D' parameter.
CTG '-D' is followed by a comma delimited list
of START,END,NAME, where START is the start
bound of NAME with respect to the ARM coordinates
in the Chado file, and the END with respect to
the ARM.  This is in the case where '_appdata'
elements are not used. 

The code needs alot of cleanup and work, as alot of
functionality was added ad hoc.  Currently, the
writing of features/annotations is stable for the needs
of our chado database loader/writer.  Computational analysis
data input/output is still under development.
