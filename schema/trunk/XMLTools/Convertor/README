This directory contains the makefile, which
produces 2 java .class files in the 'classes'
subdirectory.  These files are GTC.class, for
Game To Chado conversion, and CTG.class for
Chado To Game conversion.

The file 'testScript' provides a roundtrip
example of running the two programs.

The first input is the file to be read, and the
second file is the output.

GTC recognizes '-' parameters.
'-a' means convert 'all', both features and
	computational analyses. This is the default.
'-g' convert gene features, but ignore computational
	analyses
'-c' convert computational analyses, but not gene
	features
For all parameters, non annotation sequences are
converted.

CTG recognizes the '-D' parameter.
CTG '-D' is followed by a comma delimited list
of START,END,NAME, where START is the start
bound of NAME with respect to the ARM coordinates
in the Chado file, and the END with respect to
the ARM.
