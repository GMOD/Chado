Changed WikiBotData and WikiBoxRow to encapsulate data in $self->data hash, instead of in random object attributes.
---
Tendency to put functionality back into things!
See overview.
Can assign a DB object to a Data object.  The data object then "knows" how to load and save itself.
WikiBoxRow objects can self-load from the db if they have a $self->row_id
WikiBoxRow objects now know how to set row_data from their own attributes based on headings.

Separate input/output/munging...in theory!!
