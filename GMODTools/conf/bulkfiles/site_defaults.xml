  <title>Site Default settings for GMODTools</title>

  <about id="site_defaults">
  This is a configuration file for GMODTools Bulkfiles
  which can be included into data release configuration
  files.  Enter common settings, include other portions
  of the configurations settings here.  
  
  Simple tags that go well here:
    ROOT = where the base path for data is
    datadir = sub directory from ROOT
    ftp_url, web_url = used in output documents
    verbose = show these 'about' comments.
  
  Using 'include' options in the xml configurations will
  add these to main configuration, but not replace main
  settings.  Includes can be nested.
