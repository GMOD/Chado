create a GFF upload tool.  It would need to:

collect input parameters, like:
  * organism pull down, plus other (which would have to give full org info)
  * analysis or not
  * if contains gene data, does it have both CDS and exon features
  * turn on --recreate_cache
  * allow delete by GFF?

Provide a link to a page to follow output.
