=head1 NAME 

  cx-chadoxml2chaos.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cx-chadoxml2chaos.pl sample/CG10833.chado-xml
  cx-chadoxml2chaos.pl -x sample/CG10833.no-macros.chado-xml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Converts Chado-XML to Chaos-XML

Note that there are different "flavours" of Chado-XML. This includes
both macro-ified and un-macroified flavours. This script will handle both

As a first step, this script will expand all macros in the the input
file to their full expanded form. This step has no effect if the
macros are already expanded.

As a second step, the expanded chado-xml is converted to chaos-xml

Both steps happen via the use of XSL Stylesheet Transforms

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over

=item -x 

The input chado xml file has no macros; do not call macro-expansion step

You do not need to use this option, but performance may be faster if
you omit the expansion step if it is not required

=back 


=head1 REQUIREMENTS

You need an XSLT Processor, such as xsltproc, available as part of libxslt
